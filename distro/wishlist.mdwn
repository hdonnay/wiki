Distro Wishlist
===============

 * Modularity of system config
 * No re-packaging of things, e.g. use pip, cabal, ruby gems, cpanmin
   whenever possible.
 * static-compiled base system
 * use of git to maintain package manager
 * system communication

1. System Config
----------------

The should be a plain text file recording all installed packages,
including those installed via a third-party package manager.

 * Diffs of changes in `/etc`?

2. Integration of third-party package management
------------------------------------------------

Installation of a language/environment automatically pulls in that
package manager and hooks it into the system package manager, providing
those packages though the standard interface.

3. Compile /sbin, /bin statically
---------------------------------

Makes upgrades easier?

May cost more disk space.

4. Git-based package manager
----------------------------

I like git.

Makes upstream contributions of packages easier? 

Hooks would make building a SQLite database of packages, notification
of upgrades trivial.

5. Communication
----------------

Should have a local-only email server by default, used to send messages
to the user.

use Oak to parse log files by default? Use Oak to monitor installs?
