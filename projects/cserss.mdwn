CSE RSS feed
============
***

The CSE class websites don't have an RSS feed, which makes them hugely
unusable to anyone that doesn't want to visit their goddamn page
manually all the fucking time.

What to do
----------
***

The pages appear to be valid XHTML, so a possible course of action would
be to write an xslt for it, then have a perl script retrive the page,
transform it to RSS compliant XML, then move it to be served by a webserver.
