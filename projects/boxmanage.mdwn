**boxmanage** is to be an automated server management helper.

It should be a collection of scripts written in perl, possibly other languages, and invoked via dispatcher processes.

Dispatcher processes

the scripts should go in `/sbin/manage/` and system-wide configs in `/etc/manage`.
user-level configs should go in `~/.manage`.
