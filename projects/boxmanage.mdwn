boxmanage is to be an automated server management helper.

It should be a collection of scripts written in perl, and invoked via cron (perhaps a daemon process, `managed`?)
Scripts should be able to be invoked via sending an email. A dispatcher process should run from cron and call relevant scripts accordingly.

the scripts should go in `/sbin/manage/` and system-wide configs in `/etc/manage`.
user-level configs should go in `~/.manage`.

script ideas
------------
---
 * automatic adding of shell users/pubkeys to gitolite
 * email-based jobs:
   * user management
   * key management
   * aptitude interface

Implementation
--------------
---
Use Net::IMAP::Simple to retrieve email, then parse and call associated scripts.
