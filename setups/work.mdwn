Installed ghc-7.0.4 and haskell-platform-2001.4.0.0.

Then installed xmonad-0.10, xmonad-contrib-0.10, and xmobar-0.14
globally.

Installed newsbeuter-2.4 from source.

The only dependency not packaged on SL6 is stfl, which needs to be built
and installed like so:

    % sudo make install prefix=/usr
    % sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libstfl.so.0 /usr/lib/libstfl.so.0.22
