Windows
-------
- - -
Windows is backed up with the build-in backup tool, to `KURO\\backups\windows`.

Linux

Linux installs are backed up by rsnapshot on kuro.

To use, copy `/backups/backup.pub` into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on a new machine, and then add a stanza to `/etc/rsnapshot.conf` like this:

    # ao
    backup root@ao:/home/ ao/
    backup root@ao:/etc/ ao/
    backup root@ao:/usr/local/ ao/

OSX

Not currently backed up

 * **TODO:** put midori under rsnapshot backup
