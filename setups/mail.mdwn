##mutt
***

mutt is configured to read messages locally and send them via msmtp.

##offlineimap
***

offlineimap is configured to fetch mail from the last 60 days and store
it in subfolders inside `~/.mail`. Passwords are stored/retrieved with
python-keyring, so as to allow operation without user input. offlineimap
is run from cron.

##msmtp
***

msmtp uses the getpw.py script to retrieve passwords.

###getpw.py
***

It's literally three lines:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import keyring
    import sys

    print keyring.get_password(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])

##python-keyring
***

This can be installed via pip:

    sudo pip install keyring
