gitolite
--------
gitolite was installed via apt:

    % sudo aptitude install gitolite

This puts repositories in `/var/lib/gitolite/repositories/` and created a user "gitolite" with the home dir
of `/var/lib/gitolite`.

Some repos are mirrored out by using a post-receive hook like so:

    gitolite@kuro:~&#036; cat repositories/hmln.git/hooks/post-receive 
    #!/bin/sh
    git push --mirror git@github.com:hdonnay/hmln.git &
    git push --mirror git@bitbucket.org:hdonnay/hmln.git &

It's better to fork the mirroring commands because waiting for a slow
remote sucks. Plus, this way the mirroring is sort-of not-quite
parallel.

User repositories are allowed under `usr/$name`.

gitweb
------
gitweb was installed via apt:

    % sudo aptitude install gitweb

The actual html/js/css files are stored in `/srv/git` and it is pointed to `/var/lib/gitolite/repositories` via `/etc/gitweb.conf`

Apache is configured to point to different gitweb configs, `/etc/gitweb.conf` for `/` and `/etc/gitweb-usr.conf` for `/usr.`
This allows for user repositories to be exposed via gitweb with out cluttering the 'important' repos.

 * [gitweb](http://git.hdonnay.net)
 * [user gitweb](http://git.hdonnay.net/usr)

**The main repo page has since changed to cgit.**

Will write this up when I get a chance.

The main reasons were speed and prettier urls.

git-daemon
----------
git-daemon was installed via apt:

    % sudo aptitude install git-daemon-run

Additionally, the following line was added to every repo in gitolite.conf to enable it:

    R   =   daemon

The stupid runsrv config file didn't work by default. Here's what it ended up being:

    hank@kuro:~ % sudo cat /etc/sv/git-daemon/run 
    #!/bin/sh
    exec 2>&1
    echo 'git-daemon starting.'
    exec chpst -ugitdaemon:gitolite \
      "$(git --exec-path)"/git-daemon --verbose --reuseaddr --base-path=/var/lib/gitolite/repositories

http export
-----------
Handled with this config stanza:

    Alias /clone /var/lib/gitolite/repositories
    <Location /clone>
        Options -Indexes
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Location>

This doesn't allow for "smart" http cloning, but `git-http-backend` was
being a jackass.
