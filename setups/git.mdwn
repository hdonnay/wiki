gitolite
--------

gitolite was installed via apt:

    % sudo aptitude install gitolite

This puts repositories in `/var/lib/gitolite/repositories/` and created a user "gitolite" with the home dir
of `/var/lib/gitolite`.

Some repos are mirrored out by using a post-receive hook like so:

    gitolite@kuro:~&#036; cat repositories/hmln.git/hooks/post-receive 
    #!/bin/sh
    git push --mirror git@github.com:hdonnay/hmln.git
    git push --mirror git@bitbucket.org:hdonnay/hmln.git

User repositories are allowed under `usr/$name`.

gitweb
------

gitweb was installed via apt:

    % sudo aptitude install gitweb

The actual html/js/css files are stored in `/srv/git` and it is pointed to `/var/lib/gitolite/repositories` via `/etc/gitweb.conf`

git-daemon
----------

git-daemon was installed via apt:

    % sudo aptitude install git-daemon-run

Additionally, the following line was added to every repo in gitolite.conf to enable it:

    R   =   daemon

 * **Still needs a hold punched in the firewall**
