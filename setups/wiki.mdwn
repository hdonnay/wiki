repository
----------

the repository needed to go though gitolite. The remote should be set to something like:

    gitolite@localhost:wiki.git

rather than

    ~/respositories/wiki.git

##Pandoc
***
Switched the wiki to render the markdown using Pandoc with [this](https://github.com/hdonnay/pandoc-iki) plugin.

The way to get nice titles I like is now

    title
    -----
    ---

or

    ##title
    ***

**but not**

    title
    -----
    - - -

because pandoc parses that into a table.

The .pm was installed into `/usr/local/lib/site_perl/Ikiwiki/Plugins/`. It kept bitching when trying to render until
the 'math' settings were set in `wiki.setup`.

##MathJax
***
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) is used to render $\LaTeX$ and $\TeX$ as needed, and was set up according to [this](https://raw.github.com/hdonnay/pandoc-iki/master/README).
