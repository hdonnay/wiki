* The virus has infected *all* computers on the network.
* The virus has infected *some* computers on the network.
* The virus has infected *a single* computers on the network.
* The virus has *not* infected *any* computers on the network.

Notice the differences.

$P(x)$: The computer 'x' is infected.
$Q(x)$: x > 5
$R(x)$: Loop is executed when x > 5
$S(x,y)$: Loop is executed when x > 5 $\land$ y < $\pi$

* Some symbols:
  * $\forall x$ - for all x
  * $\exists x$ - there exists an x
  * $\exists !x$ - there is an unique x

$$
\begin{aligned}
\forall x \quad x^2 \geq 0\\
\exists x \quad x^3 \geq 0\\
\exists !x \quad x^2 = 0\\
\forall x \quad \lnot (x^2 = i)\\
\text{Universe: }\mathbb{R}
\end{aligned}
$$
