Theroem 1 - p600
----------------

There's a path from 'a' to 'b' of length n $\geq$ iff (a,b)$\exists R^n$.

 * induction

connectivity relation
---------------------

$R^*$

consists of all pairs (a,b) with a path (of any length) between them.

Theroem 2
---------

R* = transitive closure fo R

Lemma: if there's a path rom a to b in R, rhen there's a path of length at most n-1 if a!=b, and at most n if a=b.

Theorem 3
---------

The matrix for the transitive closure is $M_R \lor M_{R^2} \lor ... M_{R^n}$
$$
M_R = 
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
\end{array}\right)
$$

Boolean product

algorythm:

A = M_R
B = A
for i = 2 to n
  A = A (bool product) M_R
  B = B v A
return B

Warshall's Algorthm
-------------------

$$
W^0 = M_R\\
W^k \text{is the C-1 matrix with ith row jth column entry 1 iff there's a path from the ith to the jthe element going through elements {v_1 .. v_k}}\\
W^1 =\text{ connected through element }1\\
W^2 = 
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{array}\right)
\\
\\
W^{k}_{ij} = W^{k-1}_{ij} \lor \left(W^{k-1}_{ik} \and W^{k-1}_{kj}\right)
$$
